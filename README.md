```python
# Cell 2: Data Collection
ticker = 'YOUR_TICKER.NS'  # Change to your stock ticker
start_date = datetime.now() - timedelta(days=730)  # Adjust time period
end_date = datetime.now()

# Cell: Forward Pricing
risk_free_rate = 0.06      # Adjust based on country
dividend_yield = 0.008     # Adjust based on stock
```

## Key Formulas Used

### Daily Returns
```
Return = (Price_t - Price_t-1) / Price_t-1
Log Return = ln(Price_t / Price_t-1)
```

### Value at Risk (VaR)
```
VaR_α = μ - Z_α × σ
```

### Sharpe Ratio
```
Sharpe = (R_p - R_f) / σ_p
```

### Forward Price
```
F = S₀ × e^((r - q) × T)
```

### Beta
```
β = Cov(R_stock, R_market) / Var(R_market)
```
